## [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/#/description)
### Problem Description

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Note:
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.

### Solutions
#### Solution 1

Brutal method, for each `nums1` element, find it's index in `nums2`, then search right-ward and return the first element which is greater than it; if no greater element exists then return -1.

Code:
  ```
  var nextGreaterElement = function(findNums, nums) {
      var result = [];
      findNums.forEach(function(val) {
          var startIdx = nums.indexOf(val)+1;
          while (startIdx < nums.length) {
              if (nums[startIdx] > val) {
                  result.push(nums[startIdx]);
                  return;
              } else {
                  startIdx++;
              }
          }
          result.push(-1);
      });
      return result;
  };
  ```
  
#### Solution 2

Build a map for each element of `nums2`, key is the element, and value is the element's next greater element.
If an element is not a key of map, means this element doesn't have next greater element.
Use stack and map to implement.

```
var nextGreaterElement = function(findNums, nums) {
    var stack = [];
    var map = [];
    var result = [];
    nums.forEach(function(num) {     // for each element of nums
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length-1] < num) {   // num is the next greater element for each element smaller than 
            map[stack.pop()] = num;                                 // it in stack. pop-out and put in map.
        }
        stack.push(num);             // push num in stack for further use
    });
    
    findNums.forEach(function(num) {
        result.push(map[num] || -1);
    });
    
    return result;
}
```
