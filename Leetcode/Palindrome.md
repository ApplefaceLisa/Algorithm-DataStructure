## [647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/description/)
### Description
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

## [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/description/)
### Description
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

For example, given s = "aab",
Return
```
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]
```
