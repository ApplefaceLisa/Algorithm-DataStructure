## [581. Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/description/)
```
Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that if you only sort this subarray in ascending 
order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.

You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.

Example 1:
Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
Output: 5
Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending 
order.

Note:
Then length of the input array is in range [1, 10,000].
The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means <=.
```

### Solution
1. Brute force

   Compare `nums` with `nums_sorted`, the leftmost index can be obtained by finding the first index at which the two elements of nums and nums_sorted are different while its rightmost index can be obtained by finding the last such index. The length between left and right index is the result. Time complexity is O(nlogn), space O(n).
   
   ```
   /**
    * @param {number[]} nums
    * @return {number}
    */

    var findUnsortedSubarray = function(nums) {
      let sorted = nums.slice().sort((a,b)=>a-b);
      let left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
      while (left < nums.length && nums[left] == sorted[left])  left++;
      while (left < right && nums[right] == sorted[right])  right--;
      return right-left+1;
    };
   ```
