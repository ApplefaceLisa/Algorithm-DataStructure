# About data structures learning.


# Abstract
- Array
  - Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.
  
- List
  - List is a linear data structure, which contains a sequence of elements.
  - The list allows adding elements on different positions, removing them and incremental crawling.
  
- Stack
  - The stack is a data structure, which implements the behavior "last in – first out" (LIFO).
  - the elements could be added and removed only on the top of the stack.
  
- Queue
  - The abstract data structure "queue" satisfies the behavior "first in – first out" (FIFO).
  - Elements added to the queue are appended at the end of the queue, and when elements are extracted, they are taken from the beginning of the queue (in the order they were added).
  
- Set
  - set are unordered collections of unique elements.

# Linear Data Structures
A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached.

## List
- Array List

- (Singly) Linked List

- Doubly Linked List

- Circular Linked List

## Array

## Matrix

## Stack

## Queue

## Set

## Map

## Hashing

# Non-linear Data Structures
Every data item is attached to several other data items in a way that is specific for reflecting relationships. The data items are not arranged in a sequential structure.

## Tree
- binary tree
- binary search tree
- heap

## Graph
